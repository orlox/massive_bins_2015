# 2016 binary models
These models are intended to reproduce the single star LMC models from Brott etal. (2011)
(A&A, 530, A115), and also include the contribution from binary systems. Just in case,
input data is provided as well for the GAL and SMC models of Brott (2011).

The different folders contain the following:
- 1_composition: MESA work directory that uses the chem module to produce input composition
files for MESA with the custom GAL, LMC and SCM mixtures of Brott etal. (2011).
