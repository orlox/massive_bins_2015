# MESA input data
Files to reproduce my MESA models. Be aware that to simplify my existance I include as well input data for 
incomplete projects. **Please do not use those without contacting me.**

Throughout this README, it is assumed that the user already has MESA properly installed,
if not, follow in detail the instructions given in the [MESA website](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/prereqs.html).

- [2016_double_bh](2016_double_bh): Input data to reproduce models from the paper "A new route 
towards merging massive black holes", Marchant et al. (2016) (A&A 588, A50)
- [2016_ULX](2016_ULX): Input data for ULX models from case M evolution, **WIP, please contact 
me if you intend to use these.**
- [2016_binary_models](2016_binary_models): Input data to crease single and binary models with the 
custom GAL, LMC and SMC composition of Brott et al. (2011) (A&A, 530, A115), **WIP, please contact 
me if you intend to use these.**
- [2016_contact](2016_contact): Input data to create models for contact binaries in the LMC. **WIP, please
contact me if you intend to use these.**

If you simply want to get a copy of one of these projects, just do, for example,
