# MESA input data
Files to reproduce my MESA models. Be aware that for simplicity I include as well input data for 
incomplete projects. **Please do not use those without contacting me.**
- [2016_double_bh](2016_double_bh): Input data to reproduce models from the paper "A new route 
towards merging massive black holes", Marchant etal. (2016), A&A 588, A50 (2016)
- [2016_ULX](2016_ULX): Input data for ULX models from case M evolution, **WIP, please contact 
me if you intend to use these.**
- [2016_binary_models](2016_binary_models): Input data to crease single and binary models with the 
custom GAL, LMC and SMC composition of Brott etal. (2011) (A&A, 530, A115), **WIP, please contact 
me if you intend to use these.**
- [2016_contact](2016_contact): Input data to create models for contact binaries in the LMC. **WIP, please
contact me if you intend to use these.**
